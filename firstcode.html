    <h2>toxic relation in friendhip</h2>
    <p>A toxic friend, far from helping relieve stress, can add to it. They might say or do things that upset you when
        Pyou spend time together,
        for example.
        Even when you aren't with them, you might spend a lot of time thinking back to your negative interactions,
        which can make you feel tense, irritable, even downright awful.</p>
